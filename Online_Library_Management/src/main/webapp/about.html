Using our resources you will be able to:
Read around your subject
Find academic quality information for your assignment
Find different viewpoints
To begin with
There are different ways to access the content we provide. You can search across most areas of the library using Library Search. This will give you results covering different subjects and resource types.

There are four main types of resources.

Ebooks are like traditional books but available online
Ejournals are similar to a magazine but available on the internet; the content is rigorously checked for academic quality
Articles - each issue of a journal contains a number of articles written by expert academics
Databases  - in the library context, this means a collection of ejournals or ebooks which can all be searched at the same time</p>
